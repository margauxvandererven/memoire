	abstract = {We present our current knowledge of the solar chemical composition based on the recent significant downward revision of the solar photospheric abundances of the most abundant metals. These new solar abundances result from the use of a 3D hydrodynamic model of the solar atmosphere instead of the classical 1D hydrostatic models, accounting for departures from LTE, and improved atomic and molecular data. With these abundances, the new solar metallicity, Z, decreases to Z=0.012, almost a factor of two lower than earlier widely used values. We compare our values with data from other sources and analyse a number of impacts of these new photospheric abundances. While resolving a number of longstanding problems, the new 3D-based solar photospheric composition also poses serious challenges for the standard solar model as judged by helioseismology.},

Beyond the classical slow (s) and rapid (r) processes, there is observational evidence for neutron-capture processes that operate at neutron densities in between, at different distances from the valley of β stability. Here, we review the main properties of the s process within the general context of neutron-capture processes and the nuclear physics input required to investigate it. We describe massive stars and asymptotic giant branch stars as the s-process astrophysical sites and discuss the related physical uncertainties.

These stars are the most Li-rich massive AGBs found to date, super Li-rich AGBs with log ε (Li) ∼ 3−4. The high Li overabundances are accompanied by weak or no s-process element (i.e. Rb and Zr) enhancements. A comparison of our observations with the most recent hot bottom burning (HBB) and s-process nucleosynthesis models conﬁrms that HBB is strongly activated during the ﬁrst TPs but the 22Ne neutron source needs many more TP and third dredge-up episodes to produce enough Rb at the stellar surface. We also show that the short-lived element Tc, usually used as an indicator of AGB genuineness, is not detected in massive AGBs, which is in agreement with the theoretical predictions when the 22Ne neutron source dominates the s-process nucleosynthesis.},

The models are used to generate column densities of molecules of particular interest in S stars. The column densities are used to develop guidelines by which the observed molecular spectra of S stars may be interpreted in terms of physical variables. The main conclusions are: (1) molecular band strengths are not good temperature indicators from star to star because of their great C/O sensitivity; carefully selected atomic lines or infrared colors should produce a reliable temperature index; (2) the band strength of TiO is a good C/O indicator in S stars when adjusted for its temperature variations; (3) the molecular spectra of S stars cannot be interpreted solely by C/O effects. When allowance is made for molecular equilibrium effects, the band strength of ZrO could provide an abundance index for S stars.},

	abstract = {The properties of S stars are investigated thanks to a large observing program devoted to the well-defined Henize sample (205 S stars south of δ = -25̂ and brighter than R = 10.5, covering all galactic latitudes), in order to derive the respective properties of the intrinsic S stars (genuine thermally-pulsing AGB stars) and of the extrinsic S stars (post mass-transfer binaries). The stellar sample is first cleaned from a few stars misclassified as S thanks to UBV Geneva photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy. These low-resolution spectra also allow to successfully distinguish subclasses within the S star family. Dedicated Geneva photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy have led to the discovery of two symbiotic S stars. The more stringent difference between extrinsic and intrinsic stars is their technetium content, but several other observational parameters are shown to be efficient to some extent in segregating intrinsic S stars from their extrinsic masqueraders (UBV , JHKL and IRAS photometry, radial-velocity standard deviation, shape of the CORAVEL cross-correlation dip, combination of band strength indices derived from low-resolution spectra). Multivariate classification has been performed on the Henize data sample in order to guarantee a classification as objective as possible and handling at the same time a large number of parameters. The resulting clusters separate efficiently extrinsic and intrinsic S stars, allowing to derive the respective properties of these two distinct stellar classes. The population difference between intrinsic and extrinsic S stars is for the first time clearly demonstrated, since intrinsic S stars are far more concentrated towards the galactic plane than extrinsic S stars (zint = 200 ∓ 100 pc and zext = 600 ∓ 100 pc), and are therefore believed to belong to a younger, more massive population. The frequency of extrinsic and intrinsic S stars in the magnitude-limited Henize sample amounts to 33\% and 67\%, respectively. In a volume-limited sample, this proportion is subject to large uncertainties mainly because of uncertain luminosities. There are probably as many as 40\% extrinsic stars among S stars in a volume-limited sample. Based on observations carried out at the European Southern Observatory (ESO, La Silla, Chile) and at the Swiss 70 cm telescope (La Silla, Chile)},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} To be able to investigate the chemical history of the entire Milky Way, it is imperative to also study its dust-obscured regions in detail, as this is where most of the mass lies. The Galactic Center is an example of such a region. Due to the intervening dust along the line of sight, near-infrared spectroscopic investigations are necessary to study this region of interest.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The aim of this work is to demonstrate that M giants observed at high spectral resolution in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}- and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-bands (1.5–2.4 μm) can yield useful abundance ratio trends versus metallicity for 21 elements. These elements can then also be studied for heavily dust-obscured regions of the Galaxy, such as the Galactic Center. The abundance ratio trends will be important for further investigation of the Galactic chemical evolution in these regions.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We observed near-infrared spectra of 50 M giants in the solar neighborhood at high signal-to-noise and at a high spectral resolution with the IGRINS spectrometer on the Gemini South telescope. The full {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}- and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-bands were recorded simultaneously at {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 45 000. Using a manual spectral synthesis method, we determined the fundamental stellar parameters for these stars and derived the stellar abundances for 21 atomic elements, namely, F, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Na, Al, K, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ce, Nd, and Yb. We systematically studied useful spectral lines of all these elements in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}- and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-bands.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We demonstrate that elements can be analyzed from {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}- and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band high-resolution spectra, and we show which spectral lines can be used for an abundance analysis, identifying them line by line. We discuss the 21 abundance ratio trends and compare them with those determined from APOGEE and from the optical Giants in the Local Disk (GILD) sample. From high-resolution {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}- and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band spectra, the trends of the heavy elements Cu, Zn, Y, Ce, Nd, and Yb can be retrieved. This opens up the nucleosynthetic channels, including the {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-process and the {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-process in dust-obscured populations. The [Mn/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trend is shown to be more or less flat at low metallicities, implying that existing non-local thermodynamic equilibrium correction is relevant.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} With high-resolution near-infrared spectra, it is possible to determine reliable abundance ratio trends versus metallicity for 21 elements, including elements formed in several different nucleosynthetic channels. It is also possible to determine the important neutron-capture elements, both {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater}- and {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-dominated elements. This opens up the possibility to study the chemical evolution in detail of dust-obscured regions of the Milky Way, such as the Galactic Center. The M giants are useful bright probes for these regions and for future studies of extra-galactic stellar populations. A careful analysis of high-quality spectra is needed to retrieve all of these elements, which are often from weak and blended lines. A spectral resolution of {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≳ 40 000 is a further quality that helps in deriving precise abundances for this range of elements. In comparison to APOGEE, we can readily obtain the abundances for Cu, Ce, Nd, and Yb from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band, demonstrating an advantage of analyzing high-resolution spectra.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The origin and evolution of fluorine in the Milky Way Galaxy is still under debate. In particular, the increase in the [F/Fe] in metal-rich stars found from near-IR HF lines is challenging to explain theoretically. Chemical evolution models with current knowledge of yields from different fluorine-producing stellar sources cannot reproduce these observations.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The aim of this work is to observationally study the Galactic chemical evolution of fluorine, especially for metal-rich stars. We want to investigate whether the significant rise in fluorine production at high metallicities can be corroborated. Furthermore, we want to explore the possible reasons for this upturn in [F/Fe].{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We determined the fluorine abundances from 50 M giants (3300 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 3800 K) in the solar neighborhood spanning a broad range of metallicities (−0.9 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} 0.25 dex). These stars are cool enough to have an array of lines from the HF molecule in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band. We observed the stars with the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) spectrometer mounted on the Gemini South telescope and on the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Harlan J. Smith{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Telescope at McDonald Observatory and investigate each of 10 HF molecular lines in detail.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Based on a detailed line-by-line analysis of ten HF lines, we find that the R19, R18, and R16 lines (22 699.49, 22 714.59, and 22 778.25 Å) should primarily be used for an abundance analysis. The R15, R14, and R13 lines at 22 826.86, 22 886.73, and 22 957.94 Å can also be used, but the trends based on these lines show increasing dependence on the stellar parameters. The strongest HF lines, namely R12, R11, R9, and R7 lying at 23 040.57, 23 134.76, 23 358.33, and 23 629.99 Å should be avoided. The abundances derived from these strongest lines show significant trends with the stellar parameters, as well as a high sensitivity to variations in the stellar microturbulence, especially for coolest and most metal-rich stars. This leads to a huge scatter and high fluorine abundances for supersolar metallicity stars, not seen in the trends from the weaker lines for the same stars.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} When estimating the final mean fluorine abundance trend as a function of metallicity, we neglect the fluorine abundances from the four strongest lines (R7, R9, R11, and R12) for all stars and use only those derived from R16, R18, and R19 for the coolest and most metal-rich stars. We confirm the flat trend of [F/Fe] found in other studies for stars in the metallicity range of −1.0 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} 0.0 dex. We also find a slight enhancement at super-solar metallicities (0 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} 0.15 dex) but we cannot confirm the upward trend seen at [Fe/H] {\textgreater} 0.25 dex. The HF line is intrinsically temperature sensitive, which calls for studies of stars with highly accurate and homogeneous stellar parameters. The spread in our trend is presumably caused by the temperature sensitivity. We need more observations of M giants at super-solar metallicities with a spectrometer that covers as many of the HF lines as possible, for instance the IGRINS spectrometer, to confirm whether the metal-rich fluorine abundance upturn is real or not.},

Therefore, the relevant nuclear physics data can be determined by experiments. With this rather reliable data basis, s-process nucleosynthesis offers an important testground of models for the late stages of stellar evolution, which are supposed to be the s-process site. The empirical counterpart for such models is the so-called classical s-process, a purely phenomenological picture, that is successfully used to derive the resulting abundances as well as information on the physical conditions during the s-process. The status of this classical approach is reviewed with emphasis on the implications for various stellar models of the s-process and in the light of results obtained by stellar spectroscopy.

In dust-obscured regions, the inner bulge and Galactic center region, the intrinsically bright M giants observed in the NIR are an optimal option for studying stellar abundances and the chemical evolution of stellar populations. Because of the uncertainties in photometric methods, a method for determining the stellar parameters for M giants from the NIR spectra themselves is needed.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We develop a method for determining the stellar parameters for M giants from the NIR spectra. We validate the method by deriving the stellar parameters for nearby well-studied M giants with spectra from the spectral library of the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrograph (IGRINS). We demonstrate the accuracy and precision of our method by determining the stellar parameters and {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-element trends versus metallicity for solar neighborhood M giants.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We carried out new observations of 44 M giant stars with IGRINS mounted on the Gemini South telescope. We also obtained the full {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater} band IGRINS spectra of six nearby well-studied M giants at a spectral resolving power of {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 45 000 from the IGRINS spectral library. We used the tool called spectroscopy made easy in combination with one-dimensional (1D) model atmospheres in a radiative and convective scheme (MARCS) stellar atmosphere models to model the synthetic spectrum that fits the observed spectrum best.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The effective temperatures that we derive from our new method (tested for 3400 ≲ {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ≲ 4000 K here) agree excellently with those of the six nearby well-studied M giants, which indicates that the accuracy is indeed high. For the 43 solar neighborhood M giants, our {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, log {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, [Fe/H], {\textless}i{\textgreater}ξ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}micro{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [O/Fe] agree with APOGEE with mean differences and a scatter (our method – APOGEE) of −67±33 K, −0.31±0.15 dex, 0.02±0.05 dex, 0.22±0.13 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, −0.05±0.06 dex, 0.06±0.06 dex, and 0.02±0.09 dex, respectively. Furthermore, the tight offset with a small dispersion compared to the APOGEE {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} indicates a high precision in our derived temperatures and those derived from the APOGEE pipeline. The typical uncertainties in the stellar parameters are found to be ±100 K in {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, ±0.2 dex in log {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, ±0.1 dex in [Fe/H], and ±0.1 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} in {\textless}i{\textgreater}ξ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}micro{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-element trends versus metallicity for Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti are consistent with the APOGEE DR17 trends for the same stars and with the GILD optical trends. We also find a clear enhancement in the abundances for thick-disk stars.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} S stars are transition objects between M-type giants and carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). They are characterized by overabundances of s-process elements. Roughly half of them are enhanced in technetium (Tc), an s-process element with no stable isotope, while the other half lack technetium. This dichotomy arises from the fact that Tc-rich S stars are intrinsically producing s-process elements and have undergone third dredge-up (TDU) events, while Tc-poor S stars owe their s-process overabundances to a past pollution by a former AGB companion which is now an undetected white dwarf, and since the epoch of the mass transfer, technetium has totally decayed.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our aim is to analyse the abundances of S stars and gain insights into their evolutionary status and on the nucleosynthesis of heavy s-process elements taking place in their interior. In particular, the location of extrinsic and intrinsic S stars in the HR diagram will be compared with the theoretical onset of the TDU on the thermally pulsing AGB.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} A sample of 19 S-type stars was analysed by combining HERMES high-resolution spectra, accurate {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Data Release 2 (GDR2) parallaxes, stellar-evolution models, and newly designed MARCS model atmospheres for S-type stars. Various stellar parameters impact the atmospheric structure of S stars, not only effective temperature, gravity, metallicity and microturbulence but also C/O and [s/Fe]. We show that photometric data alone are not sufficient to disentangle these parameters. We present a new automatic spectral-fitting method that allows one to constrain the range of possible atmospheric parameters.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Combining the derived parameters with GDR2 parallaxes allows a joint analysis of the location of the stars in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and of their surface abundances. For all 19 stars, Zr and Nb abundances are derived, complemented by abundances of other s-process elements for the three Tc-rich S stars. These abundances agree within the uncertainties with nucleosynthesis predictions for stars of corresponding mass, metallicity and evolutionary stage. The Tc dichotomy between extrinsic and intrinsic S stars is seen as well in the Nb abundances: intrinsic, Tc-rich S stars are Nb-poor, whereas extrinsic, Tc-poor S stars are Nb-rich. Most extrinsic S stars lie close to the tip of the red giant branch (RGB), and a few are located along the early AGB. All appear to be the cooler analogues of barium stars. Barium stars with masses smaller than 2.5 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} turn into extrinsic S stars on the RGB, because only for those masses does the RGB tip extend to temperatures lower than {\textasciitilde}4200 K, which allows the ZrO bands distinctive of S-type stars to develop. On the contrary, barium stars with masses in excess of {\textasciitilde}2.5 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} can only turn into extrinsic S stars on the E-AGB, but those are short-lived, and thus rare. The location of intrinsic S stars in the HR diagram is compatible with them being thermally-pulsing AGB stars. Although nucleosynthetic model predictions give a satisfactory distribution of s-process elements, fitting at the same time the carbon and heavy s-element enrichments still remains difficult. Finally, the Tc-rich star V915 Aql is challenging as it points at the occurrence of TDU episodes in stars with masses as low as {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 1 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} S stars are late-type giants that are transition objects between M-type stars and carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). They are classified into two types: intrinsic or extrinsic, based on the presence or absence of technetium (Tc). The Tc-rich or intrinsic S stars are thermally pulsing (TP-)AGB stars internally producing {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-process elements (including Tc) that are brought to their surface via the third dredge-up (TDU). The Tc-poor or extrinsic S stars gained their {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-process overabundances via the accretion of {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-process-rich material from an AGB companion that has since turned into a dim white dwarf.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our goal is to investigate the evolutionary status of Tc-rich S stars by locating them in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram using the results of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Early Data Release 3 (EDR3). We combine the current sample of 13 Tc-rich stars with our previous studies of 10 Tc-rich stars to determine the observational onset of the TDU in the metallicity range [−0.7; 0]. We also compare our abundance determinations with dedicated AGB nucleosynthesis predictions.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We derived the stellar parameters using an iterative tool that combines HERMES high-resolution spectra, accurate {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 parallaxes, stellar evolution models, and tailored MARCS model atmospheres for S-type stars. Using these stellar parameters, we determined the heavy-element abundances by line synthesis.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} In the HR diagram, the intrinsic S stars are located at higher luminosities than the predicted onset of the TDU. These findings are consistent with Tc-rich S stars being genuine TP-AGB stars. The comparison of the derived {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-process abundance profiles of our intrinsic S stars with the nucleosynthesis predictions provide an overall good agreement.
